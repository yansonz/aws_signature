## Synopsis

This is an example how to invoke API with AWS authentication in R.

## Note

Using AWS Sagemaker, you can deploy your own R model. However, you might have some problem when you try to invoke your endpoint due to AWS authentication, the thing is easily done by [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com) though.

This project was carried out to show how to make AWS authorization info and how to easily invoke the API in R.
If you use other languages like Python or Nodejs which has AWS SDK, you don't need to do this demading stuff. Just use the SDK with thanks!
