## Synopsis

This is an example how to invoke API with AWS authentication in R.

## Motivation

Using AWS Sagemaker, you can deploy your own R model. However, you might have some problem when you try to invoke your endpoint due to AWS authentication, the thing is easily done by [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com).
This project was carried out to show how to make AWS authorization info and how to easily invoke the API like Postman does.
